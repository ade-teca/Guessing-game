## This game was created in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
### It´s a interactive game where the user can choose the limits of numbers that he/she want to guess.
### Where if the user give the wrong choosing the game will inform if it´s too high or too low.

### This is the first of many projects that want to share here in my [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/ade-teca).
### I hope y'all enjoy it.
